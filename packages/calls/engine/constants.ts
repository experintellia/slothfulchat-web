 * uses; matching them keeps our offers/answers wire-compatible.
 *
 * NONE of this touches the DeltaChat message payload — see `signaling.ts` for
 * that. These constants configure the local `RTCPeerConnection` so the SDP we
 * generate has the same shape (single bundled transport, one gathered TURN
 * candidate) the peer expects.
 *
 * Pure data. No DOM/React imports. `RTCConfiguration` etc. are ambient WebRTC
 * lib *types* only (erased at runtime).

 *   TURN candidate; this is what makes the "send after first relay candidate"
 *   non-trickle heuristic safe.
 * - `iceCandidatePoolSize: 1` — pre-gather before `setLocalDescription` so the
 *   offer/answer is ready quickly after `getUserMedia` resolves.
 * - `iceTransportPolicy: "all"` — standard ICE (direct-preferred, relay
 *   fallback). No forced-relay (that is deferred to issue #93 per docs/calls.md).
